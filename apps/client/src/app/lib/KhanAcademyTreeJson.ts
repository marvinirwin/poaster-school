To do this you must survey a cross section of students from all around the country and all backgrounds. The data can then be statistically analyzed to give a more accurate picture of what tv show is most popular. So let's dive into a discussion of statistics, including box and whisker plots, bar charts, pictographs, line graphs, and dot plots.",

                "description": "In Algebra 1, students solves linear and quadratic equations, and learned how the two processes are based on the same logical principles. In this unit, we extend these processes to solve a greater variety of equations, like rational and radical equations. We learn that we may sometimes get extraneous solutions. We also solve systems that include quadratic equations, and learn how we can use graphs to estimate a solution for any kind of equation!",

The course uses narratives—both large and small—to create a coherent view of the world’s past, present and future. \n\nWHP 1750 to the Present starts in, you guessed it, 1750 and extends to the present. Why start a course in 1750? We answer this question in the first unit of the course and then do a deep dive on revolutions, imperialism, and globalization—all from a global or world history perspective. The course is designed for high school students. ",

Art existed in the context of dramatic events such as industrialization, urbanization, economic upheaval, migrations, and wars. Countries and governments were re-formed; women’s and civil rights’ movements catalyzed social change.\n\nArtists assumed new roles in society. Styles of art proliferated and often gave rise to artistic movements. Art and architecture exhibited a diversity of styles, forming an array of “isms.” Works of art took on new roles and functions in society and were experienced by audiences in new ways. Art of this era often proved challenging for audiences and patrons to immediately understand.",

We examine the conditions for allocative efficiency, using the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost principle, and the ways in which externalities, public goods, and the market distribution of income create market failures even in competitive free-market economies. In addition, we study the effectiveness of government policies such as subsidies, taxes, quantity controls, and public provision of goods and services, which are designed to correct market failures and achieve allocative efficiency.

We examine the conditions for allocative efficiency, using the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost principle, and the ways in which externalities, public goods, and the market distribution of income create market failures even in competitive free-market economies. In addition, we study the effectiveness of government policies such as subsidies, taxes, quantity controls, and public provision of goods and services, which are designed to correct market failures and achieve allocative efficiency.
